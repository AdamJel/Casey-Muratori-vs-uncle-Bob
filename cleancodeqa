CASEY: Thanks @unclebobmartin for taking the time to answer these questions! Maybe we can start with just some clarification.

Most explanations on Clean Code I have seen from you include all the things I mentioned in the video - preferring inheritance hierarchies to if/switch statements, not exposing internals (the "Law of Demeter"), etc. But it sounds like you were surprised to hear me say that. Could you take a minute before we get started to explain more fully your ideas on type design, so I can get a sense for where the disconnect is here?
