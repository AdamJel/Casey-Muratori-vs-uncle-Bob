**CASEY**: Thanks [@unclebobmartin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin) for taking the time to answer these questions! Maybe we can start with just some clarification.

Most explanations on Clean Code I have seen from you include all the things I mentioned in the video - preferring inheritance hierarchies to if/switch statements, not exposing internals (the "Law of Demeter"), etc. But it sounds like you were surprised to hear me say that. Could you take a minute before we get started to explain more fully your ideas on type design, so I can get a sense for where the disconnect is here?

**BOB**: The disconnect.  Hmmm.  I’m not sure there is one.  

I watched the first half of your video.  After that I figured that I had caught the drift.  I responded in one thread that I thought your analysis was essentially correct. I also thought that your rhetoric was a bit inaccurate in representing “clean code”.  I don’t remember exactly what that inaccuracy was; and it doesn’t really matter. 

So…. Yes, absolutely, the structures you were presenting are not the best way to squeeze every nanosecond of performance out of a system. Indeed, using those structures can cost you a lot of nanoseconds.  They are not efficient at the nanosecond level.  Long ago this would have been generally important.  We worried about the cost of function call overhead and indirection.  We even unwound loops if we could.  This was especially true in embedded real time environments.

But the kinds of environments where that kind of parsimony is important are nowadays few and far between.  The vast majority of software systems require less than 1% of a modern processor’s power. What’s more, processors are so cheap and available that it is a trivial matter to add more of them to a system. These facts change the trade-off away from program performance to the performance of the development team, and their ability to create systems, and keep those systems running. And it is those needs where the ideas of Clean Code come into play.

It is economically better for most organizations to conserve programmer cycles than computer cycles. So if there is a disconnect between us, I think it is only in the kinds of contexts that we prioritize.  If you are trying to squeeze every nanosecond from a battery of GPUs, then Clean Code may not be for you; at least in the most taxing of your deepest inner loops.  On the other hand, if you are trying to squeeze every man-hour of productivity from a software development team, then Clean Code can be an effective strategy towards that end.

**CASEY**: Just to get a little bit more concrete, so I understand what you're saying here, can we pick some specific software examples? For instance, I would assume we are both familiar with using Visual Studio and CLANG/LLVM. Would those both be reasonable examples of what you are calling the vast majority of software that requires less than 1% of a modern processor?
